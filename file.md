Hello,
My name is Susan. I'm fourteen and I live in Germany. My hobbys are go to discos and jogging, sometimes I hear music in the radio. In July I went swimming in a sea . I haven't any brothers or sisters. We take busses to scool. I visit year 9 at my school. My birthday is on Friday. I hope I will become a new guitar.
I'm looking forward to get a e-mail from you.

Yours,
Susan
